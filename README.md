The project includes booking information for the two hotels namely City hotel and Resort hotel we have to analyze the factors that influence the revenue of the each hotel type from different subsets of data.

In this project I will do Exploratory Data Analysis on the given dataset. The project suggests measures that can be implemented to reduce cancellations and secure revenue. For example, hotels can offer discounts or promotions to customers who book early or who book for longer stays. Hotels can also offer incentives such as free parking or free breakfast to customers who book directly with them instead of through third-party websites.

This EDA project involves following steps:

Firstally i have dealt with cleaning and preprocessing of the data removing inconcistencies from the data like checking null values duplicates and handling null values and dropping irrelevant data these all steps comes under Data Wrangling.

Secondly visualizing the data that is our Exploratory Data Analysis part in this I used various chart to explore and visualize the data. From this i get various insights from the prespective of business like hotel to make more room liked by guests to add more meals preffered by guests and determining the busiest month in which booking are most and preparing few months before for the same.

The project concludes that by analyzing hotel bookings data and understanding cancellations patterns, hotels can take steps to reduce cancellations and increase revenue.
